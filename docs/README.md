## News
With time, I hope to post usage, papers, etc. which relate to MiMA here. If you're a MiMA user, please let me know of any news at <coding@martinjucker.com>.

* February 2020: New release (v1.1) adds restart from arbitrary initial conditions (as used in [Yamada and Pauluis (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1175/JAS-D-16-0329.1) below) and possibility to use the Navy high-resolution land-sea mask.
* January 2020: Two new papers published using MiMA for research on climate dynamics. These papers have further developed MiMA and their additions will be published in the upcoming v2.0: 
  * [Garfinkel, C.I., I. White, E.P. Gerber, M. Jucker, and M. Erez (2020): _The building blocks of Northern Hemisphere wintertime stationary waves_, Journal of Climate, doi:10.1175/JCLI-D-19-0181.1](https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-19-0181.1) which, among other important findings, shows that MiMA is just as good as any CMIP5 model to represent Northern Hemisphere stationary waves.
  * [White, I.P., C. Garfinkel, E. Gerber, M. Jucker, P. Hitchcock, and J. Rao (2020): _The generic nature of the tropospheric response to sudden stratospheric warmings_, Journal of Climate, doi: 10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0703.1](https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0703.1) which examines the evolution of naturally occurring versus synthetically forced Sudden Stratospheric Warmings.
* August 2019: [Iceberg](https://research-iceberg.github.io) article about MiMA's various choices for mixed layer depth and albedo distribution: [_The surface of an aquaplanet GCM_](https://research-iceberg.github.io/papers/M_Jucker_201907/). PDF: <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3358284" target="_blank">doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3358284</a>
* March 2018: [Isca framework](https://empslocal.ex.ac.uk/people/staff/gv219/ISCA/index.html) (which contains MiMA) reference paper published in Geoscientific Model Development: [Vallis _et al._, 2018: *Isca, v1.0: a framework for the global modelling of the atmospheres of Earth and other planets at varying levels of complexity*, Geosci. Model Dev., doi:10.5194/gmd-11-843-2018](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-843-2018)
* February 2018: Talk and poster about MiMA at the [2nd Pan-GASS meeting](http://singh.sci.monash.edu/Pan-GASS/index.shtml). The poster can be viewed [here](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.6118934.v1).
* August 2017: Bugfix patch (v1.0.1) addresses incoming SW radation bugs.
* June 2017: Ray Yamada and Olivier Pauluis use MiMA for baroclinic lifecycle studies: [Yamada, R., and O. Pauluis, 2017: Wave-mean-flow interactions in moist baroclinic lifecycles. J. Atmo. Sci., 74, 2143-2162, doi:10.1175/JAS-D-16-0329.1](https://doi.org/10.1175/JAS-D-16-0329.1)
* June 2017: MiMA reference paper published in Journal of Climate:
[M Jucker and EP Gerber, 2017: *Untangling the annual cycle of the tropical tropopause layer with an idealized moist model*, J Clim, doi:10.1175/JCLI-D-17-0127.1](http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-17-0127.1).
