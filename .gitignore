#            or github.com/github/gitignore
#
# To ignore globally, git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
#   then, add anything to always ignore into the file ~/.gitignore_global
#
# To ignore a file already being tracked:
#   add file to .gitignore
#   un-track file:
#     git rm file (to remove the file altogether), or
#     git rm --cached file (to leave file in the repo and the working dir, but not track anymore)
#
# Note: git ignores empty folders
#
# Examples:
# to ignore all text files: *.txt
# to ignore all directories with name dir: dir
# to ignore only one specifig directory: /path/to/directory
# to ignore all files with dir: dir/
# to negate anything, add !: !index.txt to not ignore index.txt but all other .txt files
